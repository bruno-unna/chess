Forsyth-Edwards Expanded Notation (FEEN) describes a Chess Position. It is an one-line string. FEEN is based on FEN. Cyril Wack specified the FEEN format for cross-board and cross-style computer chess applications, that is for Shogi, Western chess, Xiangqi and for more than two dimensions, e.g. 3D chess. FEEN is a proposal by Cyril Wack. So far there are no programs or protocols supporting it.

FEEN Syntax
One FEEN string or record consists of three fields separated by a space character.

Terminal and nonterminal symbols of a variant of BNF below are embedded in ' ' resp. < >.

<FEEN> ::= <Flatten board> ' '

<Active side> ' '

<Captured actors>

Piece Placement
The Piece Placement is determined in big-endian order, from a flatten board where each dimension is separated by the terminal symbol '/' (slash), and each piece is separated by a ',' (comma character).
The pieces are identified according to the Portable Chess Notation. Uppercase letters are for Bottom pieces, lowercase letters for Top pieces.

Active side
The side to move is one lowercase letter for either bottom ('B') or top ('t').

<Active side> ::= {'B' | 't'}

Captured actors
Captured actors MUST be listed here. The actors are listed in alphabetical order, separated by an empty string.
If neither player has any captured actors, for instance on an initial position, this MUST be '-'.

Note: Captured actors are said to be in hand at Shogi.

Samples
FEEN strings of starting position:

♜♞♝♛♚♝♞♜/♟♟♟♟♟♟♟♟/8/8/8/8/♙♙♙♙♙♙♙♙/♖♘♗♕♔♗♘♖ B -

And after 1.e4:

♜♞♝♛♚♝♞♜/♟♟♟♟♟♟♟♟/8/8/4♙3/8/♙♙♙♙1♙♙♙/♖♘♗♕♔♗♘♖ t -
